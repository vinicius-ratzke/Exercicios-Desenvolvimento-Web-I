        <p> Anor Londo</p>
        <p>Anor Londo is a fictional city in the Dark Souls series of action role-playing games. Appearing in both Dark Souls and Dark Souls III, it is the seat of the power of the gods, deities of the Dark Souls world who used the power of the First Flame to destroy the Everlasting Dragons that once controlled it. By the time of Dark Souls, however, it has become an abandoned lost city, as Lord Gwyn had long since sacrificed himself to rekindle the fading First Flame. Anor Londo has been cited by critics for its design as well as the level's high difficulty, including a section guarded by two powerful archers, and the level's final boss duo, Ornstein and Smough. Edge called Anor Londo "as beautiful as it is deadly" and "where Dark Souls casts off restraint". Comparing it to the Divine Comedy, and the strata traversed by Dante in the poem, they equated Anor Londo with Heaven, and that it therefore "makes sense that it's the one area in the game you are incapable of reaching by your own agency".[1] Calling the first glimpses of Anor Londo "dazzling", they state that since Dark Souls is "so bleak at times, so starved of warmth and light", the city's beauty "seems almost eye-shadingly pornographic".[1] Kotaku cited the environmental storytelling of the city's design, where the obvious path forward is blocked, showing the player they do not belong there.[8] Patrick Klepek of Kotaku called the appearance of Anor Londo in Dark Souls III a "highlight" of his playthrough and the city's architecture "beautiful" and "haunting".[9]

            Den of Geek called Anor Londo one of "gaming's greatest levels", saying that it "represents the core appeal of Dark Souls", by being designed to "intimidate and impress" the player, as well as being full of mysteries.[2] Cian Maher of The Washington Post called Anor Londo one of the "eight wonders of the virtual world", calling the "gorgeously lit skyline" "striking" in comparison to the darkness of the rest of the game, and stating that "the people - or deities - who inhabit the city also contribute to its sublimity."[10] Eurogamer called revisiting Anor Londo in Dark Souls III a "surreal, melancholy experience" that "ranks among Dark Souls III's many high points", but also "shows how the series line has evolved, both technically and in its visual direction".[3]
            
            The Silver Knight archers of Anor Londo were criticized by PC Gamer's Joe Donnelly as the moment he fell out of love with the game, saying that the game never felt unfair until that moment.[11]
            
            The entire city, including a dungeon and boss, was remade in Minecraft.[12]</p>
            <p> The last born of Lord Gwyn, Gwyndolin is the leader of the Blade of the Dark Moon covenant and the only remaining deity in Anor Londo. Gwyndolin's followers are few, but their tasks are of vital importance. Although born male, due to magic and association with the moon, Gwyndolin was raised as a daughter. Gwyndolin is biologically a male and is referred to as male by Gwynevere, who lovingly calls him brother. Gwyndolin created the illusion of a sister Gwynevere to help guard over Anor Londo. An unmasking of these deities would be tantamount to blasphemy.</p>
            <p>This optional boss is located by the Darkmoon Tomb bonfire, in Anor Londo, at the very bottom of the movable spiral staircase, behind a large statue of Lord Gwyn with a corpse lying to the left of the statue.

                Note that angering Gwyndolin will be considered a sin. (NPC Hostility Sin)</p>

        <p> Ornstein and Smough</p>   
        <p>Ornstein is the captain of the Four Knights of Gwyn Lord of Cinder, serving alongside Artorias the Abysswalker, Lord's Blade Ciaran, and Hawkeye Gough. As his name would suggest, he was an honorary dragon slayer.

            He wields his Dragonslayer Spear, a sword-spear after the fashion of Gwyn's Firstborn's own weapon. He also commands the power of lightning. It is believed that he was left behind with Smough to guard Anor Londo's cathedral after the gods fled.
            
            However, there is reason to believe that Ornstein's presence in Anor Londo is an illusion, much as Gwynevere and the light of Anor Londo is a mere facade maintained by Gwyndolin. This is evidenced by his presence in Drangleic, at Heide's Tower of Flame, where we can speculate he might have fled with Gwynevere. There is also the matter of his armour being present in Archdragon Peak, suggesting he followed Gwyn's Firstborn after his betrayal, with some suggesting he even shed his armour and body to become a dragon – not least as the Nameless King echoes the Ornstein and Smough boss fight in absorbing the lightning of his stormdrake, The King of Storm.</p>
        <p>The executioner for the royal family of Anor Londo, Smough dreamed of being anointed a knight of Gwyn. However, such was his relish for his work that he soon began to eat the bones of those he had executed. Regarded as distasteful by his masters, the royal family never raised him to the rank of knight. Though, after the gods fled Anor Londo, he remains in defence of Gwynevere's illusion. Whether he does so out of loyalty to Gwyndolin or he, too, has been fooled by the illusion of sunlight is not clear. </p>
        <p>The course of this fight changes, depending on how you approach it. If you wish for an easier fight and fancy Smough's armor, you might wanna take his partner out first. If you prefer a tougher battle with an extra piece of loot, as well as Ornstein's armor, kill the crazy executioner first. Whoever you decide to kill first, you should make that decision before entering the boss area, and stick to it.</p>

        <p>Yhorm The Giant</p>
        <p> Long ago the grand giant Yhorm, the descendant of an ancient conqueror, was asked to lead the people once subjugated, serving as both their blade and shield.[1] When there were those who doubted him, he gave them a giant-slaying sword, to show his trustworthiness. He risked everything for his people in the frontlines, fighting valiantly as a one-man vanguard.[2] It is stated that he lost someone dear to him and, as a result, he forsook his greatshield.[3] Afterwards, he notched his machete to allow for two hand use, giving him an even more ferocious fighting style.[2] At some point, "lonely" Yhorm befriended Siegward of Catarina, who became a dear friend of his[4].

            Due to a curse triggered by the four female relatives of an unknown oracle, which also turned them into careless greedy creatures, the Profaned Flame, a flame that never goes out, formed[5]. This hellish flame fell out of the sky, destroying the city, yet consuming naught but human flesh, incinerating the human inhabitants[6]. The flame, despite deriving from Dark[7], actively sought to harm humanity. Yhorm became a Lord of Cinder to put the Profaned Flame to rest, even as they spoke insincerely of his role[8][6].
            
            Before burning in the First Flame, he gave his other Storm Ruler to Siegward, who promised to end Yhorm's suffering if he ever returned to life.[4][9] In the opening cutscene, we can see him howl with despair.
            
            Why he did not take his throne is uncertain, but due to the reason for his sacrifice and his reclusive nature, it is likely that he felt too much despair at the fate of his kingdom, his people, his legacy, and the world to again sacrifice himself to kindle the First Flame.</p>
